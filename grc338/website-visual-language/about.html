            <p>Birthed in the heart of southern California, The Early Worm. started as a food truck 
               serving bagel sandwiches in the sunny Anaheim streets. Lots of early mornings moving
               egg crates to serve the locals for both their morning endeavors and afternoon happenings.
            </p>
            <p>Word soon spread, and our little food truck quickly became a beloved morning ritual for 
               many. As the lines grew longer, so did our dream of creating a space where people could 
               slow down and savor the start of their day. That dream finally took root in our first 
               brick-and-mortar café, a cozy spot filled with the same warmth and hustle that fueled 
               us from the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>Every recipe on our menu still carries a piece of those early mornings on the 
               streets—simple, honest, and made with care. We’re proud to continue serving the community 
               that lifted us up, one hearty breakfast at a time. And no matter how much we grow, The 
               Early Worm will always stay true to its humble sunrise beginnings."
